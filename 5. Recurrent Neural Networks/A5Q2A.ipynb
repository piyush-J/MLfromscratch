Seeing her shabby, unkempt appearance, the pastor guessed the reason and, taking her by the hand, took her inside and found a place for her in the Sunday School class. The child was so touched that she went to bed that night thinking of the children who have no place to worship Jesus.\n",

In the past, the IRS has revoked the tax-exempt status of various Scientology organizations, accusing them of operating in a commercial manner and of financially benefitting private individuals. Although the suit accuses the IRS of decades of wrongdoing, a principal focus of the case stems from a criminal tax investigation that the agency launched into Hubbard and the church in 1984 and whether it was connected to Scientology's application for tax exemption a year earlier. Additionally, the church maintains that the Los Angeles IRS district office planned to deny several Scientology churches tax exemption for the express purpose of causing \"a final halt to\" and the \"ultimate disintegration of\" Scientology. In 1954, Scientologists, not Hubbard, founded the first Church of Scientology in Los Angeles.

Bernie Sanders’ campaign manager on Thursday reiterated the senator’s reasoning for voting in favor of the Clinton administration’s 1994 Crime Bill despite serious reservations. The House version of the bill included a ban on semi-automatic assault weapons. Still, Sanders voted for the crime bill, largely because it included some provisions that he strongly approved of, like the Violence Against Women Act and a 10-year assault weapons ban. This is a punishment bill, a retribution bill, a vengeance bill. He voted against the 1991 crime bill. / 1 ✓\n",

This is totally illegal.\" Donald Trump Tying the issue to the current special counsel investigation of possible ties between Russia and his campaign, Trump called on investigators to redirect their efforts to what he said were accusations that the Obama administration tried to “give Iran secret access” to the U.S. financial system. The nuclear agreement committed signatories “to give Iran access to pools of its money held overseas.” U.S. efforts in this case, said the former official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid fueling the issue, were “aimed solely to allow the movement of Iran’s own funds” from a third country to a European bank, “where Iran could then make use of them.”\n",

      "Although the subcommittee’s Democratic minority sat in on many of the investigation meetings, which began in the summer of 2016, it did not sign on to the report. That number reflects only what Iran has transferred back to the country, and belies the fact that U.S. officials are actively urging banks to give Iran even more access to the international banking system. A former Obama official countered that issuing a “narrow specific license” for the transaction “cannot be described as granting access to the U.S. financial system.” Administration actions did not authorize Iran to conduct dollar transactions or business with U.S. banks or provide entry to the U.S. system.

Mitt Romney Since the end of the recession, the state has been regularly depositing money into the rainy day fund when revenues have exceeded projected amounts, and Wisconsin’s rainy day fund currently has a balance of $279 million.

While such a preferential rate may have made sense as a short-run measure designed to bring out-of-state companies into the state’s tax collection system, in the long-run it is indefensible to offer businesses with no local presence a tax advantage over in-state businesses. Trump has also charged that the Internet retailer hurts competitors and local governments by failing to pay sales taxes. This collection gap is harming local governments’ ability to fund vital programs, and it is contributing to an unlevel playing field for local businesses because millions of shoppers are able to pay less tax if they choose to buy products from out-of-state companies over the Internet rather than at local stores. The tax filing service TaxJar explains that “Illinois wants sellers who made a sale into Illinois from outside the state [to] charge a flat Illinois ‘use tax’ rate of 6.25% … You are not required to charge any local sales tax rates.”[10]\n",
      "\n",
      "Similarly, TaxJar states that in Colorado, out-of-state retailers should collect a special “retailer’s use tax” that “does not include any local city or county taxes that may be applicable.”[11] The Colorado Department of Revenue clarifies that those “city and county use taxes are paid directly to those jurisdictions if applicable” and urges sellers to “contact the cities and counties directly for more information on local use taxes.”[12] But since many Colorado cities lack use taxes or levy those taxes at lower rates than their ordinary sales taxes, it appears that out-of-state e-retailers will sometimes find themselves collecting less tax than their locally-based competitors. Local companies may have a substantial competitive advantage because of their greater understanding of, and focus on, the local customer, as well as their more established local brand names. / 0 ✓\n"

    "Model iii that was trained on the claim concatenated with the claimant and 5 related sentences performed the worst on the training and test set. \n",
    "\n",
    "The RNN architecture with linear units is prone to the vanishing gradients problem. Since the documents with the 5 related sentences concatenated is much longer, it is tough for the neural network to backpropagate the error to earlier time steps of the network (especially where it was processing the claim itself, arguably an important feature). Long range dependencies are tough to capture in our vanilla architecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "The network is prone to forgetting the earlier hidden state, especially from the claim itself since it was embedded into the hidden state first. A recency effect takes place. The entire hidden state is also a fixed size vector, so it is tough for longer documents that have the 5 sentences concatenated at the end to preserve enough meaningful information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Model ii that used the claim and the claimant concatenated performed best on the training and test set. The second best performer was model i that used only the claim itself. This shows that the shorter document size enabled the network to preserve meaningful features in the embedding. It was also able to pick up the claimant as an important feature that it used to discriminate between sources and boost the accuracy."
